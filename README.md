# Data Representation Project
This repository contains the files for the final project of Data Representation module.

This is an employee database created using Flask and the web interface can be used to perform CRUD operations on the database. Basic information about each employee is present in the database. That is; ID, Name, Position and Age. This is basically a rehash of the sample lab project. 

Following is the URL to access the pythonanywhere deployment.
https://psukumar.pythonanywhere.com/employee.html


I have created another pythonanywhere deployment with employee name split into first name and last name.
https://psukumar2.pythonanywhere.com/employee.html


The folder 'CreateDB' contains the scripts I used to create the database on the local machine.

The folder 'deploytopythonanywhere' contains a copy of the files I used to configure pythonanywhere. A separate repository is used to pull these files to pythonanywhere.
